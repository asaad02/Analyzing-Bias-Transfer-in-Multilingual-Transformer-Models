# Analyzing Bias Transfer in Multilingual Transformer Models

This project explores how biases from dominant languages (e.g., English) transfer to underrepresented languages (e.g., Inuktitut) in multilingual transformer models. Using the Canadian and Nunavut Hansard corpora, we aim to analyze cross-linguistic bias and knowledge transfer, providing insights into the ethical development of multilingual NLP systems.

---

## Project Objectives

1. **Bias Analysis**: Investigate whether biases inherent in English-language datasets influence Inuktitut representations in multilingual models.
2. **Embedding Comparisons**: Analyze and compare word embeddings across unilingual and multilingual models to detect bias transfer and semantic shifts.
3. **Ethical NLP Development**: Provide recommendations for fairer representation of low-resource languages in multilingual NLP systems.

## Project Outline

### 1. Model Training Setup

- **Model 1: Canadian Hansard Model**  
  - **Data**: Full Canadian Hansard corpus (excluding Nunavut-related content).
  - **Purpose**: Establish a baseline for English-language embeddings and biases.

- **Model 2: Nunavut Hansard Model**  
  - **Data**: Full Nunavut Hansard corpus (aligned with Canadian Hansard).
  - **Purpose**: Capture embeddings reflective of Inuktitut cultural and political nuances.

- **Model 3: Multilingual Model (Overrepresented)**  
  - **Data**: Combined Canadian (80%) and Nunavut (20%) Hansard datasets.  
  - **Purpose**: Simulate real-world multilingual model conditions and analyze cross-linguistic bias transfer.

- **Model 4: Multilingual Model (Balanced)**  
  - **Data**: Equal proportions (50/50) of Canadian and Nunavut Hansard datasets.  
  - **Purpose**: Assess whether balanced data representation mitigates bias transfer.

### 2. Methodology

#### Data Preprocessing
- Clean and tokenize text while handling Inuktitut's unique morphological structure.
- Align data by sampling equivalent time spans to control for historical and temporal effects.

#### Training
- Use a consistent transformer architecture (e.g., RoBERTa DistilBERT, TinyBERT) across all models.
- Fine-tune models to ensure embeddings reflect the unique properties of the training datasets.
- Implement early stopping and validation checks to prevent overfitting.

#### Embedding Analysis
- Extract embeddings for culturally significant terms (e.g., "elder," "community," "tradition").
- Compare embedding spaces using metrics like cosine similarity and dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, PCA).

#### Visualization
- Visualize clustering and semantic shifts in embeddings to identify bias transfer.
- Use embedding distance metrics (e.g., cosine distance) to quantify the influence of dominant language datasets.

### 3. Cross-Language Bias and Knowledge Transfer Evaluation

- **Bias Indicators**:  
  - Observe semantic shifts for terms associated with cultural and gender biases in the Canadian Hansard.
  - Analyze whether Inuktitut-specific terms lose their cultural integrity in multilingual models.

- **Semantic Integrity**:  
  - Assess if culturally significant terms maintain their unique embeddings or align more closely with English-biased terms in multilingual setups.

---

### 4. Recommendations

- **Balanced Data Strategies**: Advocate for equal representation in training datasets to minimize bias transfer.
- **Cultural Preservation**: Emphasize training approaches that respect linguistic and cultural nuances of underrepresented languages.
- **Ethical NLP Practices**: Encourage transparency in dataset selection and model evaluation for fairness.
